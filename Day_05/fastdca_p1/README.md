# Dependency Injection:
Dependency Injection is a programming technique where required objects or values (called dependencies) are provided to a function or class from the outside, rather than being created inside it.

## Benefits of Dependency Injection:
1. Reusability â€“ Dependencies can be reused across multiple parts of the app.
2. Modularity â€“ Keeps code clean and separated; each part focuses on one task.
3. Testability â€“ Makes it easier to test by injecting mock or fake dependencies.
4. Maintainability â€“ Easier to update or change a dependency in one place.
5. Flexibility â€“ You can easily switch between different versions of a dependency.

4. Multiple Dependencies in One Route
5. Class-Based Dependency with Error Handling
